## Introduction

Digital recognition is a crucial aspect of various applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. This project demonstrates the process of building a digital recognition model using machine learning techniques.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHARANSAI2003/Digital_Recognition.git
   cd Digital_Recognition

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
1. To explore and run the code, open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
    jupyter notebook Digital_Recognition.ipynb

## Data Collection

The data for this project is collected from Kaggle, e.g., MNIST dataset. The dataset contains [briefly describe the dataset, e.g., images of handwritten digits].

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, the data undergoes preprocessing steps such as normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance the model's performance.

The model used in this project is Sklearn's model. The training process involves:

1. Splitting the data into training and validation sets.
2. Defining the model architecture.
3. Compiling the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.
4. Training the model on the training data.
5. Evaluating the model on the validation data.
